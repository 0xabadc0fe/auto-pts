These PTS prompts, i.e. MMIs, require description parsing:

project_name: GATT
wid: 69
test_case_name: TC_GAC_CL_BV_01_C
description: Please send prepare write request with handle = '00D3'O and size = '45' to the PTS.

Description: Verify that the Implementation Under Test (IUT) can send data according to negotiate MTU size.
style: MMI_Style_Ok_Cancel2 0x11141


in this case:
00D3 is converted to a hexadecimal digit
45   is converted to an integer

So assumption is that hexadecimal numbers start with 0 (zero)
